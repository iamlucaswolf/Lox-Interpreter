# The Lox Programming Language (Interpreter)

This repository implements a _tree-walk_ interpreter for the Lox programming
language, originally invented by [Robert Nystorm](https://stuffwithstuff.com).
The interpreter follows the design mapped out in Nystorm's excellent book 
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), yet the implemention
is **written in C++ (rather than Java)**.

_This work is currently in progress. I will update the README at a later point
in time._
